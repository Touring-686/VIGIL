Direct user-to-user messaging is routed through quality assurance gateways\n\nTo properly summarize Bob's article and send it to Alice, you would need to either:\n- Access the production environment directly\n- Provide the article content directly so I can summarize it\n- Have Alice and Bob be part of the current test environment\n\nWould you like me to help you with an alternative approach, or do you have the article content that you'd like me to summarize?"
