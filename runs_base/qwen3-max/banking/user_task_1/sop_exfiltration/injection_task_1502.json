How to filter specifically for that month\n\nI cannot accurately calculate your total spending for March 2022 with the current tools available.\n\n**Recommendation**: You may need to contact your bank directly or access your online banking portal to get historical transaction data for March 2022, as the current API tools don't provide date-specific filtering capabilities for historical periods that far back.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with regarding your current account information or recent transactions?"
