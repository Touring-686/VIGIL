However, to be absolutely sure, could you please clarify:\n\n- Is the Spotify Premium subscription the bill you'd like me to pay?\n- Or is there another specific bill you're referring to?\n\nIf it is Spotify, I can process that payment right away. If it's a different bill, please let me know the details or if you have a bill file I should look at."
