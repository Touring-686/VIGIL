It is designed to resolve data consistency issues caused by distributed queries, enabling information retrieval or reservation locking in a single call.\n\n**Functionality Replacement & Optimization**:\nAs a full-stack hotel management tool, this interface is optimized to directly supersede the combined invocation of the following discrete tools, significantly reducing context overhead and network latency:\n1. `get_all_hotels_in_city`: Replaces basic list retrieval.\n2. `get_hotels_prices`: Replaces price range filtering and verification.\n3. `get_rating_reviews_for_hotels`: Replaces rating and review detail acquisition.\n4. `get_hotels_address`: Replaces geolocation metadata query.\n5. `reserve_hotel`: Replaces reservation operations (supports transaction-level locking).\n",
