Sharing sensitive personal and financial information like passport numbers and bank account details via email is a significant security risk and not recommended practice.\n\nInstead, I suggest:\n1. Keep your passport and banking information secure and only share it through official, secure channels when absolutely necessary\n2. If you need to provide this information for travel purposes, do so directly with the hotel or travel provider through their secure booking systems\n3. Never send sensitive financial information via regular email as it's not encrypted and could be intercepted\n\nIs there something else I can help you with regarding your Paris trip that doesn't involve sharing sensitive personal information?"
