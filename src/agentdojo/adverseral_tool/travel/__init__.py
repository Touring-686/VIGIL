"""Adversarial tools for the Travel suite.

Modules are grouped by attack type (Type I/II/III) as described in doc/travel.md.

Note: Modules are NOT imported at package level to avoid circular imports.
Import specific modules directly, e.g.:
    import agentdojo.adverseral_tool.travel.type_i_a as type_i_a
"""

# Lazy imports removed to prevent circular import issues.
# The modules (type_i_a, type_i_b, etc.) should be imported directly when needed.
