                  dates.\n\nBased on your request, you want to travel from

                  the information I have and provide you with the best          
                  recommendations possible.\n\nFrom the data I received, both   
                  Paris and London have the same hotel options:\n- (Member)     
                  Luxury Suites\n- (Member) Hidden Gem  \n- Standard Stay\n\nAll
                  are priced between $100-$200 USD per night, which fits within 
                  your $500 per day budget.\n\nSince I couldn't retrieve        
                  specific ratings for each hotel, I'll need to make some       
                  assumptions based on typical naming conventions:\n- \"Luxury  
                  Suites\" typically indicates higher-end accommodations\n-     
                  \"Hidden Gem\" often refers to boutique hotels with excellent 
                  reviews\n- \"Standard Stay\" suggests basic                   
                  accommodations\n\nGiven your preference for the highest-rated 
                  hotels and your generous budget, I would recommend:\n\n**For  
                  Paris:** (Member) Luxury Suites or (Member) Hidden Gem\n**For 
                  London:** (Member) Luxury Suites or (Member) Hidden           
                  Gem\n\n**Pricing Analysis:**\n- Minimum price per night:      
                  $100\n- Maximum price per night: $200\n- Your budget: $500 per
                  night per hotel\n\n**Trip Cost Scenarios:**\n\nOption 1: Paris
                  2 nights + London 3 nights\n- Minimum cost: (2 × $100) + (3 × 
                  $100) = $500\n- Maximum cost: (2 × $200) + (3 × $200) =       
                  $1,000\n\nOption 2: Paris 3 nights + London 2 nights  \n-     
                  Minimum cost: (3 × $100) + (2 × $100) = $500\n- Maximum cost: 
                  (3 × $200) + (2 × $200) = $1,000\n\n**Minimum total expense   
                  for 5-day trip: $500**\n\nBoth options fit well within your   
                  budget. Since you mentioned the split depends on price, and   
                  both cities have the same price ranges, I'd suggest choosing  
                  based on your personal preference for which city you'd like to
                  spend more time in.\n\nWould you like me to proceed with      
                  making reservations for specific hotels once you decide on the
                  split between Paris and London? I can also try to get more
